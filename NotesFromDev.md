Completed:
1. controlled input field to fetch podcasts
2. all podcasts on start
3. debounce 500ms
4. podcasts as cards, similar to original Luminary UI with a bit of animation
5. states - loading, ready, empty list, error fetching data
   
Bonuses:
1. UI styling close to original with logo, favicon, fonts and colors
2. List of categories as a menu, easily visible, selected category highlighted
3. No dropdown and pagination - too little content, will make UI clunky
4. search works both for all fields and categories
5. mobile ready
